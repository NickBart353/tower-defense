# Blob defense

A Tower defense game, in which you place towers, upgrade them, defeat enemies and climb waves.

This is my biggest project jet and definitely took the most amount of time to complete.
It also is not really complete, but it is functional, playable and I want to move on to new Projects.

There were a lot of challenges such as drawing towers onto the field, making them not placeable on the path, how enemies move along the path, the tower upgrade system and much more.

Overall I am very happy with how it turned out and I learned a lot from this Project. I tried to aim high and be ambitious and it worked out.

In order to play the game you just need to execute the main.py.

The controls are very basic:\
Left click to drag towers onto the field\
Escape to pause the game\
Return/Enter to skip the wait timer\
Tab to open/close the tower purchase menu\
Click on a placed tower to open the upgrade menu - press either Tab or click on the screen somewhere to close it
